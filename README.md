This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Uploaded from VS-Code
Steps:
1. In Terminal -> Navigate to the local project directory and create a local git repository:
    git init
2. Once succesful, click on 'Source Control' icon in left navbar in VS-Code. One should be able to see files ready to be commit-ed. Press on 'Commit' button, provide comments, stage the changes and commit the files.
 Alternatively you can run from CLI

   git commit -m "Your comment"
3. Go to Github.com account and create a new Repository. Exclude creating 'README.md', '.gitIgnore' files. Also do not add any License to the repo. Sometimes these settings cause issue while pushing in.

4) Copy the link to this newly created GitHub Repository.

5) Come back to the terminal in VS-CODE and type these commands in succession:
  git remote add origin <Link to GitHub Repo>     //maps the remote repo link to local git repo

  git remote -v                                  //this is to verify the link to the remote repo 

  git push -u origin master                      // pushes the commit-ed changes into the remote repo
